                <p>Looking for quiet, peaceful spots where I can practice guitar without disturbing others. Any suggestions from fellow musicians? I’m particularly interested in places that might have good acoustics but are also respectful to the community.</p>
                <p>I’ve been learning for about 6 months now and need somewhere I can practice my chord progressions and finger exercises without worrying about noise complaints. Ideally somewhere that’s accessible in the evenings after work.</p>

                        <p>I’ve found the Botanical Gardens have some great quiet spots, especially early morning around 7 AM. The acoustics near the pavilion are amazing! Just be mindful of the opening hours and bring a small mat to sit on.</p>
